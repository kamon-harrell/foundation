              <p class="article-row-content-description"> My take on the DBC/EDA experience so far, while limited, has been great. I'm loving the communication that my cohort has already developed, and i'm very excited to see what the rest of the course holds for me and those in my cohort. My initial thoughts are that the experience seems daunting, and intimidating, but not insurmountable. </p>

              <p class="article-row-content-description">         What I have gleaned from both the video, and the 1st chapter of the SIY material was both impactful, and insightful. I had no idea that simply listening to your body, (gut feeling) was actually based in science, and that your body was starting to send signals before your brain could register them. What I've learned is that i need to slow down, practice my mindfulness, and listen to my intuition. What ive also learned is that these are things that you dont just conjure, they are skills that need to be honed, and practiced in order to be used in the most effective form. The two minutes of mindfulness felt very satisfying, and helped me regain focus on the current assignment!</p>

                  <p class="article-row-content-description">I had a few opinions on meditation before starting the book, having read into it a little in the past. My thoughts were that it could be helpful with your daily life, and it could help you lead a calmer more stable life. From what ive read so far this seems to be the case that the book makes as well. I was not aware that midfullness was such a component of meditation, but now that i have read a few more details, both practices seem to be very cohesive.</p>

                  of bringing ones attention back to a center. Both of these practices are very complimentary, and some could argue are one in the same.</p>

              I would say that the thing I liked the most was the excerise for the Siberian Northern Rail Road, and the medaphor at the beggining of the chapter regarding the horse. The horse medaphor spoke to me beacause it makes sense, if we allow our emotions (the horse) to run wild without our control, how can we ever expect to master our body and mind?</p>

                  <p class="article-row-content-description">When inspected individualy, all three of the prospects seems great, its only when we compare them against each other that we see the advantages and disadvantages of one over the other. When we are living life only for pleasure, we find ourself in a constant state of peaks and valleys. Pleasure, as is its nature, is short lived, and we must eventually return to baseline. This leaves us striving for the next temporary fix, trying to make our selves happy again. As im sure you've determined by now, this is unsustainable, and not the best way to find true fulfillment. When we switch our focus to passion, we are starting on the right path to sustainable happiness. Working with passion translates to flow, which is a state of being where you become completely absorbed in the current activity, and everything else fades into the background. This more often than not occurs when an individual is involved with an activity that they find plesuarable, and at just the right difficulty to keep them engaged. To easy of an activity, and the indivivual loses interest, to difficult, and the indivivual gets discouraged. Many people report while in flow that they experience elevated happiness, which, the more often someone is in the flow state, the more it transfers to their everyday lives. Finally, we get to the option that seems like the most sustainable method for achieving long term happiness, which is living life with a higher purpose. All of this makes sense to me in ways i hadent thought about before. When i think about living my life for a higher purpose, it makes complete sense that this is the best way to be happy, for when you are living with the intent of doing something beyond yourself, it brings a sense of calm that cannot be achieved when living for selfish means.</p>

              <p class="article-row-content-description">Much like everyone else, i thought the example from the Udacity tutoriul was perfect. Thinking about the DOM, HTML, and CSS as different parts of a house works well in many ways. The HTML is your foundation, which gives you a blue print for how you would want your site to be layed out, IE where you would want your rooms, kitchen etc. When you get the structure completed, you can bring out CSS to decided the texture and paint of the walls, what the flooring is made of, furniture and the like. And finally we get the best part of anything, the part that you use. Javascript is the dimmable lights, your IOT connected thermostat and refrigerator, your amazon echo, and your computer, the interactive things that change a room into more than just 4 walls. </p>

              respond to different actions. I had followed the instructions perfectly (or so I thought), and be all accounts, everything should work. I save the changes to my document, and reload my browser, arrogantly thinking the super cool changes I just made will work perfectly, except... there's no changes, infact, it all stopped working. I searched and searched through my code, looking for the error that shattered my website. I looked online at our study resources, asked for help online and from my teacher, who looked it over and saw the error right away. After helping guide me to the source of the problem through dev tools, and some hints, I realized I was missing a set of quotes around a word, which were necessary to call the variable I was after. I felt silly for missing this small detail in my arrogance, and from this experience i have learned to be more vigilent and detail oriented, as opposed to cocky that I can do no wrong.</p>

              <p class="article-row-content-description">Scope in javascript is an interesting thing.  In most programming languages scope keeps most thing inside their respective functions, meaning they can only be used be a very specific chunk of the code. This keeps variables and other defined things from interacting with other, and creating a mess of the program. Javescript does things a little bit different by allowing variables to be interacted with outside of their specific functions. For example, I could have a variable inside of a function, and i could change the value of that variable by redefining its value inside of another function or out side of a function. Javasscript also 'hoists' variables, now im not entirely sure i understand this, but the way i think about it is that it will pick up any global variables, and bring them to the top of the program so they will be executed first, and it will try and apply those values to any and all matching variables that will accept the global value. </p>
